A rational number is a number which can be expressed in the form p/q where p and q are integers and q is not zero.

The factors of a number are integers that divide the number exactly without leaving a remainder.

Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants prepare their own food in the presence of sunlight. 
It takes place in the chloroplasts of plant cells which contain a green pigment called chlorophyll.

Matter is anything which has mass and occupies space. Matter is made up of particles.

Force is a push or pull upon an object resulting from the object's interaction with another object.

Newton's First Law of Motion states that an object will remain at rest or continue to move at a constant velocity unless acted upon by a net external force.

The SI unit of force is the newton (N). One newton is the force required to give a mass of one kilogram an acceleration of one metre per second squared.

Newton’s Laws of Motion are three basic principles formulated by "Sir Isaac Newton" that describe how objects move and interact with forces. They form the foundation of classical mechanics.

 1. Newton’s First Law (Law of Inertia)

“An object will remain at rest or move in a straight line at constant speed unless acted upon by an external force.”

In simple words: Things don’t start, stop, or change direction on their own — something has to push or pull them.
Example: A football won’t move until you kick it. Once kicked, it keeps rolling until friction or someone stops it.

2. Newton’s Second Law (Law of Force and Acceleration)

“The force acting on an object is equal to the mass of that object times its acceleration.” 
 [F = m \times a]

Meaning: If you apply more force, the object accelerates more. Heavier objects need more force to move.
Example: It’s harder to push a loaded shopping cart than an empty one because it has more mass.

3. Newton’s Third Law (Action–Reaction Law)

“For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.”
Meaning: When one object pushes another, it gets pushed back equally hard in the opposite direction.
Example: When you jump off a boat, the boat moves backward as you move forward.
